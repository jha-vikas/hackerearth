Problem2: Predict Fraudulent Transactions
Tool: R/Rstudio
Packages: 
Data files: train, test
Vaiables(other than transaction_id): 7 numerical variables, 42 categorical variables.
Variables have been anonymized.

Data preprocessing:
Following Steps were followed:
1. Zero variance variables were removed.
2. Missing values among categorical variable were put into their separate category.
3. Missing levels in categorical variables in train & test data sets were mahced, either by deleting or imputing values.
4. Categorical variables were converted into factors.

Model:

Final results are based on GBM.(Gradient Boosting). As data size was too big to be processed directly, h2o package was used.

Final GBM model used has:
1. Depth = 6 (found using grid tuning)
2. 5 fold cross validation
3. 5000 trees
4. AUC-ROC as performance metric
