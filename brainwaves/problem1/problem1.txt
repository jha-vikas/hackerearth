Problem1: Predict Annual Returns
Tool: R/Rstudio

Data files: train, test
Vaiables(other than transaction_id): 
portfolio_id 	unique ID
desk_id 	manager ID (the person handling the portfolio, it can be a team)
office_id 	place where portfolio is managed

Data preprocessing:
Following Steps were followed:
1.Missing values for each variable was checked.
2. Country code was removed as it was in line with currency. Desk id was removed as it did not seem to add any new information.
3. Using base date as 1 April 2004, a series of time based features were generated.
4. Train data was merged on test data using all the variables. For 2154 portfolio_id(s), it dorectly gave the return in accordance with train file. Where more than one returns were obtained, median was used.
5. Highly correlated variables were removed.
6. Libor values were imputed based on other varialbes.

Model:

Conditional inference tree with 5 fold cross validation was used as final model
